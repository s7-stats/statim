**Higher Level Interface for Statistical Inference**

## Package Overview

What does [statim](https://github.com/joshuamarie/statim) mean?

[statim](https://github.com/joshuamarie/statim) is a Latin word for
“immediately, at once”. The name carries a double meaning:

- *stat*: as in statistics, the domain this package lives in
- *im* (*statim*): as in “immediate”, signalling that inference should
  be expressible as a direct declaration, not somewhat a sequence of
  mechanical steps

This simply means: you declare *what* statistical inference you want to
perform, then [statim](https://github.com/joshuamarie/statim)
immediately delivers *how*.

## Why statim?

R has a rich statistical ecosystem, but hypothesis testing is served by
an assortment of disconnected functions. R gained a grammar for graphics
([ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)) and one for data manipulation
([dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)), but statistical inference has no
equivalent: each testing function ships with its own interface, its own
way of specifying data, and its own output format. There is no shared
grammar for inference: no way to say *what* you want to test without
simultaneously committing to *how* the procedure carries it out.

[statim](https://github.com/joshuamarie/statim) is an attempt to
re-imagine this from the ground up, the same way
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) introduced a grammar for
graphics without replacing base plotting functions. The core idea is
that any inferential procedure can be described in three steps: define
the structure of the data
([`define_model()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/model-define-base.md)),
declare what you want to infer
([`prepare_test()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/prepare-test.md)),
and optionally recalibrate the estimation method
([`via()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/via.md)). The
procedure executes only when you call
[`conclude()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/conclude.md).

This separation matters because it makes statistical workflows
*composable*. Switching from a classical to a permutation procedure does
not require rewriting your code; it is a single addition to the
pipeline:

``` r

# Classical t-test
sleep |> define_model(x_by(extra, group)) |> prepare_test(TTEST) |> conclude()

# Permutation t-test: one line added, nothing else changes
sleep |> define_model(x_by(extra, group)) |> prepare_test(TTEST) |> via("permute", n = 1000L) |> conclude()

# The same pipeline shape works for any registered test
cars |> define_model(rel(speed, dist)) |> prepare_test(CORTEST) |> conclude()

# For a quick result, the eager form skips the pipeline entirely
TTEST(x_by(extra, group), sleep)
CORTEST(rel(speed, dist), cars)
```

## Installation

The package is yet to be submitted into CRAN.

``` r

# Stable version (not yet released)
install.packages("statim")
```

For the time being, you can install the current implementation on
GitHub:

``` r

# Development version from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("joshuamarie/statim")
```

## General Usage

Loading a library comes with preference. In this example,
[`library()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html) is used for a simple
demonstration:

``` r

library(statim)
```

All you need to know is that the usual workflow of
[statim](https://github.com/joshuamarie/statim) has three usual steps:

``` r

sleep |>                                # 1
    define_model(extra %by% group) |>   # 1              
    prepare_test(TTEST) |>              # 2         
    update(.ci = 0.9) |>                # 2      
    conclude() |>                       # 3           
    tidy()                              # 3          
```

1.  *Model processor and definition*, where defining the model *to be
    analyzed* happens at the beginning during statistical inference.
    Typically, this step where supplying either a data frame or a
    `<model_id>` objects into
    [`define_model()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/model-define-base.md)
    occurs, and then some functions to be appended in the future
    updates.

2.  *Parameterization* and proceed to writing the estimation process of
    the statistical inference pipeline. It is either a model-based
    inference (e.g. linear regression) or H-test inference
    (e.g. t-test). They are lazy-loaded, and you should be able to do
    anything.

3.  *Execution and retrieval* then (re-)executes the first 2 steps and
    retrieves the output.

## Core Semantics

The package is designed around three ideas:

1.  **A shared grammar**: every inferential procedure follows the same
    shape –
    [`define_model()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/model-define-base.md),
    [`prepare_test()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/prepare-test.md),
    [`conclude()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/conclude.md)
    – regardless of which test or model ID is used. The model ID objects
    (e.g. `x_by`, `rel`, `pairwise`) determines what the test does; the
    grammar stays the same. Eager forms
    ([`TTEST()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/TTEST.md),
    [`CORTEST()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/CORTEST.md),
    …) provide a shortcut when the full pipeline is not needed.

2.  **Composable pipelines**: build up a test specification lazily,
    recalibrate the estimation method with a single
    [`via()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/via.md)
    call, and execute with
    [`conclude()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/conclude.md).

3.  **Extensible by design**: every test is a
    [`stat_define()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/stat-infer-definer.md)
    object; bring your own engine, your own method, your own
    implementation. Auto dispatch handles
    [`tidy()`](https://joshuamarie.github.io/statim/reference/tidy.md)
    for your method without requiring you to write it.
